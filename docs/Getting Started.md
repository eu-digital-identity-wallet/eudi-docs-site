# Getting Started 

This section provides practical guidance for your EUDI Wallet project. Whether you are a Wallet Provider, a PID or (Q)EAA Provider, or a Relying Party, the guide provides clear, step-by-step instructions and examples to help you get started. It also assists you in evaluating how you can leverage the EUDIW reference implementation in your development project and how to make the most of it.

Let's start with your implementation!

| Role    | Description | Get Started |
| -------- | ------- |------- |
| Wallet Provider | A Wallet Provider is responsible for developing, maintaining, and operating a secure and interoperable wallet application. EUDI Wallet Providers are Member States or organisations either mandated or recognized by Member States making the EUDI Wallet available for end users. The Wallet Provider ensures compliance with EU regulations while delivering an intuitive, user-friendly, and accessible solution for all users, including those with disabilities or varying levels of digital literacy. |[Build a Wallet](../Build Wallet)|
| Issuer |   An issuer is a PID Provider or a Qualified or Non-Qualified Electronic Attestation of Attributes Provider. They are responsible for issuing the PID or the Electronic Attestion to the Wallet and providing information that can be used to enquire about the validity status of the PID or Attestation. | [Build an Issuer](../Build Issuer) |
| Verifier  | A relying party requires a verifier to accept and verifie Attestations presented by wallet user. Verifiers can be used in both online and proximity use cases.|[Build a Verifier](../Build Verifier) |
