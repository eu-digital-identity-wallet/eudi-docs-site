# EUDI Wallet Reference Implementation

The EUDI Wallet Reference Implementation consists of open-source code libraries and a reference application that are publicly available and ready to be used by Member States and stakeholders to build their own applications.

Its goal is to showcase a robust and interoperable platform for digital identification, authentication and electronic signatures based on common standards across the European Union.

Reference Implementation can be used by wallet providers, issuers and verifiers as a basis for the own solution. It also includes a comprehensive test suite, which contains tools to support testing and ensure that your implementation meets the functional requirements.
