# Build your Wallet

In this section, you will find all the resources you need to build your own Wallet application using the tools and libraries provided by the EUDI Wallet Reference Implementation. These resources include the Wallet application for Android/iOS, the Wallet Core for Android and Wallet Kit for iOS that serve as a coordinator layer between the Wallet application and the Wallet libraries, all designed to help you create a secure, user-friendly, and interoperable digital wallet solution.
