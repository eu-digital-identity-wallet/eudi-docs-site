# Build supporting ecosystem

## Overview

The EUDI Wallet Supporting Ecosystem comprises a set of auxiliary services and reference components that enable the development, testing, validation, and interoperability of Wallet implementations, Relying Parties, and Trust Service Providers. These services provide a controlled environment to simulate real-world interactions, with the following purposes:

+ Facilitate experimentation and interoperability testing between Wallets, Relying Parties, and QTSPs.
+ Provide reference implementations that illustrate the correct use of protocols.
+ Ensure that trusted interactions can be validated without using production systems or real user data.
+ Enable Member States, developers, and integrators to simulate signature flows, credential issuance, and RP authentication.

## Supporting Ecosystem Services

The Supporting Ecosystem services described in this section are:

+ [Relying Party Registration Service](./rp-registration-service.md)
+ [Remote Signature Service Provider](./rssp.md)
