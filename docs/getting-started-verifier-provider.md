# Build a verifier

If you wish to build trusted applications that can request attributes and attestations from EUDI Wallets, you need a verifier. The reference implementation offers a comprehensive set of tools, libraries and test services to support you with building your own verifier for your online or face-to-face service. 

Let’s get started!

## Try the test verifier
