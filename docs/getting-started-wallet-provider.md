# Build a Wallet

The reference implementation offers a comprehensive set of tools, libraries and test services to support and help you with building your own wallet. Let’s get started!

## Try the ready-made application

With it, you can familiarize yourself with the application and test its functionalities before starting the development of your own wallet. Instructions for setting up the application can be found [here](../eudi-app-android-wallet-ui/how-to-use-app/).
