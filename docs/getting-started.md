# Getting Started 

## Introduction

The EUDI Wallet Reference Implementation consists of open-source code libraries and a reference application that are publicly available and ready to be used by Member States and stakeholders to build their own applications.


Its goal is to showcase a robust and interoperable platform for digital identification, authentication and electronic signatures based on common standards across the European Union.
