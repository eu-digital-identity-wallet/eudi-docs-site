## Travel Scenario

The Reference Implementation includes the travel use case implementation to showcase the utilization of the EUDI Wallet in a ‘Travel’ business scenario, where the EUDI Wallet is used for several purposes, such as presenting attestations (remotely and in proximity) as well as digitally signing documents.

**User journey**

1. **Jane is preparing for her next trip with the help of her EUDI Wallet.** Jane starts by securing her essential travel documents. She issues her Digital Identity, Mobile Driving License, and Photo-ID directly into her EUDI Wallet. Each document is safely stored, ready to be accessed whenever she needs them.
2. **Booking**: With her documents in place, Jane navigates to the travel booking portal. Here, she effortlessly presents her Digital ID and other necessary documents requested by the booking portal from her EUDI Wallet to book her car rental and hotel.
3. **Renting a car**: When it comes to renting a car, Jane is redirected to a remote signing portal to conclude the rental process. Using her EUDI Wallet, she digitally signs the car rental contract, finalizing her arrangements with security and ease.
4. **Hotel check-in**: Upon arrival at her hotel, Jane approaches the check-in counter. She presents her Digital ID and Photo-ID from her EUDI Wallet to the hotel’s proximity reader. The process is quick and secure, allowing her to start relaxing in her room in no time.
