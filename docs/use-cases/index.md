# Use Cases

The development of the EUDI Wallet ecosystem is strategically driven by real-world use cases, as described in [The role of Use Cases](https://eudi.dev/latest/architecture-and-reference-framework-main/#26-the-role-of-use-cases) section of the ARF. This section specifies the different Use Cases that are already analysed and developed or being developed within the Reference Implementation of the EUDI Wallet.

The first Use Case processed is the [Mobile Driving License Toolkit](./mobile-driving-license/index.md).
