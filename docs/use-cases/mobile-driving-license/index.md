# Mobile Driving License Toolkit
Welcome to the Mobile Driving License (mDL) Implementation Toolkit.

This guide is designed to provide comprehensive technical guidance for the implementers of the mobile Driving License (mDL) Use Case. It targets a technical audience, including:

- **EU Member States**: Specifically, the issuers and verifiers responsible for implementing mDL solutions.
- **Wallet Providers**: Entities developing and providing European Digital Identity (EUDI) Wallets.
- **mDL Verifiers (Relying Parties)**: Public and private sector entities that will verify the mDL, such as police officers.

This toolkit aligns with the EUDI Wallet Architecture and Reference Framework (ARF), which provides the technical foundation to ensure interoperability, security, and privacy for the EUDI Wallet ecosystem. The development of the ARF is strategically driven by real-world use cases, including the mDL, to ensure the user experience and technical requirements are effectively addressed.
The mDL is a significant use case for the EUDI Wallet, allowing users to request, store, and present a mobile Driving Licence to prove their driving privileges in both online and offline scenarios. This toolkit will guide you through the process of building and integrating a compliant and interoperable mDL solution.
